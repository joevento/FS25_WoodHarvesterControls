        <text name="help_WoodHarvesterControls_fellingMovement" text="If you applied some pressure before cutting, the tree should start to fall in that direction.

To help the tree fall in the desired direction, you can lift the head up a bit (to leave a little space between the tree and the stump and allow it to fold) and move the crane in the opposite direction.

If you want, you can even feed it a bit as it falls. You can do it with the manual feed forward button or with the automatic program button (see the 'Feeding' option in the 'Automatic Program' section of the menu)" />

        <text name="help_WoodHarvesterControls_treeProcessingTitle" text="Processing" />
        <text name="help_WoodHarvesterControls_treeProcessing" text="You can process the tree in different ways:

- Automatic program: The computer will choose the cutting length depending on the diameter of the tree. When it changes the length, it makes a different sound so you can put those logs in a different pile. (see the 'Automatic Program' section of the menu)

- Length Presets: You can use these buttons as the main measurement system or as a complement to the automatic program, being able to force a specific length, for example in case of a damaged or dead tree. (see the 'Length Presets' section of the menu)

- Manually: You can also use the manual feed buttons to delimb the entire tree or cut any length you want.

(Check out the 'Rotator' section of the menu to see the different options and choose the one that best suits your needs. It can be a game changer when it comes to creating neat piles)" />

        <text name="help_WoodHarvesterControls_treeTop" text="When you get to the top of the tree, you can simply drop it to the side (using the open button, the open/close button or even feeding backwards). 

You can also manually feed it to the length you consider to be useful and then use it to make wood chips or take it to the paper mill. 

Another option is to cut small pieces that are easier to crush later if you are considering using a mulcher (or using the option of the menu to remove small logs)." />

        <text name="help_WoodHarvesterControls_processingFelledTrees" text="Another style of work is to process already felled trees.
	
In this example, the trees have been felled and then dragged and stacked in a flat area with good access to facilitate processing and then loading into trucks.

The harvester head can also be used as a feller buncher to fell the tree and place it in a pile for further processing or skidding." />

        <text name="help_WoodHarvesterControls_positionTheMachine" text="Position the machine perpendicular to the pile and forward. This way you can work backwards leaving the piles of processed wood in front of the machine.
		
Usually it is more comfortable to work processing to the left since the arm of the machine is usually to the right and reduces visibility. Also in this way the saw is visible, which helps to adjust the end of the log as we will see in the following steps." />

You can also use forced tilt down to help you in this process. (See the 'advanced tilt controls' section)" />

- If you want to clean a piece of the tree or that the first log has the exact measurement, you will have to make a cut. (There is an option in the menu to remove small cut logs. This will improve performance by avoiding those small pieces of wood on the ground.)
 
- If, on the other hand, the base of the tree is fine and it is not necessary to have exact measurements, you can use the saw in manual mode and only press the button briefly. This resets the measurement without the need to make the full cut." />
